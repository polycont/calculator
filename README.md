# calculator

This is my Calculator project, developed during my studies at the free and open-source full stack web development course, The Odin Project. I've absolutely adored both the curriculum and the community so far.

Everything in here was coded from scratch, by myself, with no tutorials telling me what to do or how to do it -- just using my own knowledge and growing problem solving skills.

(Note: I did get some help with the button CSS from the wonderful Josh Comeau, but that was after finishing. See his guide to 3D CSS buttons here: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/)
